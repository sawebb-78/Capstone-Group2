<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Motley Zoo Animal Rescue is dedicated to improving the lives of animals locally, nationally and internationally; alleviating their suffering and elevating their status in society through the rescue and rehabilitation of animals in need and through the education of their community on responsible pet ownership and animal welfare, advocating the value of all animal life, in hopes to end the neglect and abuse of all animals and to end the devastating pet overpopulation through spay and neuter advocacy.</p>

<h2>Our Impact</h2>
<p>Motley Zoo has a 99% live release rate. This means that while less than 1% of the animals we’ve rescued have died or were humanely euthanized, we have saved 99% of them! In comparison, Washington state has an approximate 90% live release rate. In all, we’re doing pretty well in the northwest <br>.
However in some states, live release falls to a deplorable 40%. This means in many places around our country, more than half of the animals in shelters are put to death.<br> <font= 16>How can this be?</font>
<br>It is primarily because of pet overpopulation- a very controllable, human issue. Not enough people consider spaying and neutering a priority- or they can’t afford it. Whatever the reason, nearly 4 million animals lose their lives annually because unwanted litters were born when they shouldn’t have been.
<br>Reproduction is not rocket science. It is very simple - so is the solution: spay/neuter advocacy and adoption.
<br>Our goal is to maintain this 99%, high impact as we perform this critical life saving mission- as well as to decrease euthanizations nationwide.​</p>

<h2>Happy Tails: Success Stories</h2>
<p> Pet Name: Juillie 
    Ikaika was with us for a while- seemingly being overlooked here too. But when his new mom saw him, she couldn't resist his charming personality and winning smile, falling head over heels for him! Now Ikaika has a comfortable, loving home to spend the rest of his golden years.
