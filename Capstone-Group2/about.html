        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Motley Zoo Animal Rescue is dedicated to improving the lives of animals locally, nationally and internationally; alleviating their suffering and elevating their status in society through the rescue and rehabilitation of animals in need and through the education of their community on responsible pet ownership and animal welfare, advocating the value of all animal life, in hopes to end the neglect and abuse of all animals and to end the devastating pet overpopulation through spay and neuter advocacy.</p>

                    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                        <p>We believe that all pets are precious - and none should be left behind! Nor should they be valued by a number at the bottom of a vet bill. We founded this rescue to ensure animals wouldn't fall through the cracks; to provide "someone" to care for them when there is no one else. To date, we have been that "someone" for more than 3,800 animals - many of them medically-needy - with extensive, and expensive, needs. We spare no time or expense in helping our animals become more "adoptable" for you.</p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
            <p>It is important that the results of our efforts match the immense input of time, energy, funding and quality when it comes to the number of lives saved. The level of care and quality of life is as critical as making sure we are saving as many animals as possible.</p>
